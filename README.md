Customer Churn Analysis in Telecom Industry


Introduction

Customer churn is one of the critical challenges faced by telecom companies. Retaining existing customers is more cost-effective than acquiring new ones. Therefore, it is essential for telecom companies to identify customers who are likely to leave the service. This project focuses on analyzing the telecom customer dataset and building predictive models to classify whether a customer will churn or not.

Objective
The main objective of this project is to:

Understand the key factors that contribute to customer churn.

Perform exploratory data analysis to discover patterns in the data.

Build machine learning models to predict churn.

Evaluate and compare the performance of different classification algorithms.

Dataset Description
The dataset used in this project contains information about customers of a telecom company. The data includes customer demographics, account information, service usage details, and whether the customer has churned.

Key features include:

Customer demographics: gender, senior citizen status, partner, dependents

Service details: phone service, internet service, contract type, payment method

Account information: tenure, monthly charges, total charges

Target variable: Churn (Yes/No)

Tools and Technologies Used
Python programming language

Jupyter Notebook for interactive development

Pandas and NumPy for data manipulation

Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization

Scikit-learn for model development and evaluation

Data Preprocessing
Before building the models, the data was cleaned and prepared:

Handled missing values

Converted categorical variables using label encoding and one-hot encoding

Normalized numerical values where necessary

Split the dataset into training and testing sets

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
The data was explored using visualizations and summary statistics. Key observations include:

Customers with month-to-month contracts are more likely to churn.

Churn rate is higher among customers using fiber optic internet.

Customers who do not opt for automatic payments are more likely to leave.

Tenure and total charges have a strong relationship with churn.

Model Building
Multiple classification algorithms were applied to predict churn:

Logistic Regression

Decision Tree Classifier

Random Forest Classifier

Each model was trained on the training set and evaluated on the test set using accuracy and confusion matrix.

Model Evaluation
The performance of each model was evaluated using accuracy as the main metric.

Logistic Regression achieved approximately 80% accuracy.

Decision Tree achieved approximately 79% accuracy.

Random Forest performed best with approximately 83% accuracy.

Therefore, Random Forest was selected as the final model for prediction due to its better performance.

Conclusion
This project successfully demonstrated how machine learning can be applied to predict customer churn in the telecom industry. Through data preprocessing, analysis, and model building, we identified significant factors that contribute to customer churn. The final model can help telecom companies take proactive measures to retain customers who are likely to leave.
